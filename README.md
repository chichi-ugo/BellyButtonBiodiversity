# BellyButtonBiodiversity

## Purpose
In an effort to uncover a bacterial species that synthesizes a protein that closely resembles the flavor of beef, a study was conducted in which samples were collected from participants navels where the bacteria was then cultured and documented. 

Our goal in this project was to create an interactive platform for which the reseachers and participants are able to see the outcomes of this collection.
